                    <p>Yes. You must be accepted into a participating University of Arizona graduate program as a newly matriculating student (see list of departments on our website) to participate in BRIDGES. Departmental application dates vary by program, so please communicate your interest in BRIDGES with the graduate student advisor in your program/department of choice, apply to BRIDGES by our deadline,  and submit your graduate program application according to your graduate program’s deadline.</p>

                    <p>It depends. We accept applications to the BRIDGES program (a) from incoming students for the fall semester, and (b) students who matriculated in January of the same year. Students further along in their studies are welcome to contact us to learn more about how to earn an Ecosystem Genomics minor (PhD students)  or graduate certificate (Masters students) via BRIDGES, through participation in UArizona’s Graduate InterDisciplinary Program (GIDP) in Ecosystem Genomics.</p>

NSF guidelines specify that eligibility for BRIDGES fellowships is limited to U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents. For international students, other sources of support for graduate studies (such as research assistantships, teaching assistantships, other kinds of fellowships, etc.) may be available, and such students are welcome to apply to become BRIDGES trainees.</p>

                    <p>Ecosystem genomics is an interdisciplinary and emerging field that brings together the tools of ecosystem and genomic sciences to understand how processes encoded in genes scale to ecosystems on which all life on earth depends. By scaling from the gene to ecosystem level, we can understand how wild and agricultural systems function and respond to change.The ultimate aim is to foster a new generation of diverse transdisciplinary scientists to address the challenges of sustaining natural and managed ecosystems on which humans depend, including wildlands, agricultural systems, forests, arid lands, and marine environments.</p>
